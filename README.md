# Python script to batch generate QR codes with a url and sequential numbers

Given the start of a url and how many codes you want, it will generate
sequential codes like:
https://www.roots.uk/qr/001 as 001.png
https://www.roots.uk/qr/002 as 002.png
and so on, in the same directory as the script.

Update the variables for your needs in python-batch-qr-generator-script.py
and run it on the command line by
`python3 python-batch-qr-generator-script.py`
